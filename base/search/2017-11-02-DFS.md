Backtracking is the technique of recursively exploring the tree that contains all the possible solutions to a problem. Choose a systematic way to explore all the possible cases. This approach should reflect a rooted tree, and the backtracking approach is a depth-first search of the rooted tree. Whenever the search has found a solution or determined that there are no further solutions on the branches below the current vertex, backtrack to the preceeding vertex.

A classic example of a problem that can be easily solved with this approach is the n queens problem. This problem is to determine all the possible ways to place n nonattacking queens on an n-by-n chess board.
